#  Eton Computer Science iOS App

Welcome to the Eton Computer Science iOS App.

This is a live project used by the CS department to support students on their educational journey learning iOS app development. Tutorials are provided for students to grasp new concepts, and a "scratch paper" section allows CS teachers to quickly spin up a demo or test out student code.
